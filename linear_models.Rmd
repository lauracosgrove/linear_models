```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

library(tidyverse)

theme_set(theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
```

## Examples

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)

set.seed(1)
```


Look at Airbnb data ...

```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(stars = review_scores_location / 2) %>% 
  rename(boro = neighbourhood_group,
         neighborhood = neighbourhood) %>% 
  filter(boro != "Staten Island") %>% 
  select(price, stars, boro, neighborhood, room_type)
```


Fit a model for price as an outcome.

```{r}
fit = lm(price ~ stars + boro, data = nyc_airbnb)
```

Look at some summaries.

```{r}
summary(fit)
summary(fit)$coef
coef(fit)
fitted.values(fit)
```

Look at better summaries.

```{r}
broom::tidy(fit)

fit %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value) %>% 
  mutate(term = str_replace(term, "^boro", "Boro: "),
         signif = ifelse(p.value < 0.05, "*", "")) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

Look at other summaries...

```{r}
fit %>% 
  broom::glance() %>% 
  select(r.squared, adj.r.squared)
```

Be careful with factors ...

```{r}
nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(boro = fct_infreq(boro),
         room_type = fct_infreq(room_type))

fit = lm(price ~ stars + boro, data = nyc_airbnb)

fit %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```
